In this repository, a basic classical PSHA analysis is performed for the Bogotá region, using a simplified version of the Bogotá fault as a single seismogenic source.

- The "output" folder contains the outputs generated by OpenQuake.

- The "plots" folder contains plots generated by a custom Python tool I developed for this purpose.

- The "python-aux" folder contains the source code for these tools.

The model was run on OQ 3.21
